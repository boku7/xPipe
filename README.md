# xPipe BOF (x64)
Cobalt Strike Beacon Object File (BOF) to list active Pipes & return their Owner & Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) permissions.

## Usage
### List All Local Active Pipes
To list all the pipes simply run the `xpipe` command from Cobalt Strikes interactive beacon console after importing the `xpipe.cna` agressor script.
```
beacon> xpipe \\.\pipe\lsass
[*] xpipe (IBM X-Force Red|Bobby Cooke|@0xBoku)
Pipe: \\.\pipe\lsass
Owner: Administrators\BUILTIN
Everyone
   + SYNCHRONIZE
   + READ_CONTROL
   + FILE_WRITE_DATA
   + FILE_READ_DATA
   + FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES
   + FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES
ANONYMOUS LOGON\NT AUTHORITY
   + SYNCHRONIZE
++
```

### Show Pipe Owner & DACL Permissions
To show the Owner & DACL permissions of a pipe, simply supply the pipe name as the first argument to the `xpipe` command.
```
beacon> xpipe
[*] xpipe (IBM X-Force Red|Bobby Cooke|@0xBoku)
\\.\pipe\InitShutdown
\\.\pipe\lsass
++
```

## Compile with x64 MinGW:
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc xpipe.c -c -o xpipe.o -Os
```
+ Only tested from macOS

## Why I Created This?
Recently I have been exploring C2 channels using SMB/pipes and also dabbling in privilege escalation research. To better understand how windows pipes worked, I decided to create some projects. I personally find that getting my hands dirty with the windows APIs, debugging, and tinkering is the best way I learn.

  + This project taught me how to use Cobalt Strikes beacon output formatting APIs and output text to beacon with `BeaconOutput()`. This is great because it makes the text display in the CS GUI so much cleaner. The code to make this happen is pulled from this project.

  + This BOF pretty much does the same thing as `pipelist.exe`. I used `pipelist` while developing to make sure I was getting the correct listing of named pipes.
  + `accesscheck.exe -lv` will query the permissions of the named pipes like this BOF will.
